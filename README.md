# An Introduction
Here is the code to the Lua project I created! It isn't perfect, I didn't want to waste my time making a perfect program and never applying. While I'd love to show you some more of my repositories, most of them are located either in Unity or on my work account and sadly I cannot share them easily. I would love to talk over my code and share some of my coding philosophy!
